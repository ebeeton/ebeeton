# evan.ToString();
I'm a software engineer who's been working with the .NET stack and SQL Server pretty much my whole career, but was also lucky enough to work on a couple of embedded systems in C and C++ for a few years. I enjoy writing code in Python, exploring Linux, and learning how to leverage the shell to make life easier.

## Projects
I only have one public repository at the moment, which is a [Mandelbrot plotter](https://github.com/ebeeton/fractal-demo-python) written in Python 3 using Multiprocessing, Flask, and Docker.
<!---
ebeeton/ebeeton is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
