I'm a software engineer who's been working with the .NET stack and SQL Server
pretty much my whole career, but was also lucky enough to work on a couple of
embedded systems in C and C++ for a few years. I also enjoy writing code in
Python, exploring Linux, and learning how to leverage the shell to make life
easier.

## Projects

A [Buddhabrot plotter API](https://github.com/ebeeton/buddhabrot) written in C#
using ASP.NET Core, Docker, SQL Server and Seq.

A [Mandelbrot plotter](https://github.com/ebeeton/fractal-demo-python) written
in Python 3 using Multiprocessing, Flask, and Docker.

Yet another [Buddhabrot](https://github.com/ebeeton/buddhabrot-go) and
[Mandelbrot plotter](https://github.com/ebeeton/mandelbrot-go) as an excuse to
learn Go.

## Old Stuff

A [game demo](https://github.com/ebeeton/pigiron-mt) from 2006.
